This is where my user stories live. I should have 4-5, to help plot out goals, and how I'll reach goals.

1. As someone in the research group I want see each item at least once, to know my full range of options
2. As someone on the marketing team I want to know the final votes per item to make better sales
3. As someone on the marketing team I want to know how often each picture shows, to better account for images repeating randomly
4. As the developer, I want an app that runs efficient, is easy to go back and edit, and works on browsers with different screen sizes.
